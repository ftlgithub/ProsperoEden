strings.py new <tag>          start headless/prosperoeden/ui/lang/<tag>.po from the template

The code holds the English text: tr("...") where it is drawn, TR("...") in constant tables (and
the setting labels of headless/settings_store.h). A catalog is a gettext .po file named after the
PS5 system language's tag (third_party/ps5_system_language.hpp): pt-BR.po, fr-FR.po...

check fails when a catalog
  - translates text the code no longer has, or leaves text untranslated,
  - changes the {0} {1} placeholders of a text,
  - uses a character the launcher's font does not have.
It warns when a translation is much longer than the English text (it may not fit its place).

The launcher's own font has Latin and Cyrillic letters. Chinese, Traditional Chinese,
Japanese and Korean are drawn with the subset shipped with the app
(ui/fonts/noto-sans-cjk-subset.ttf, cut from those catalogs: see subset below), overlaid
with the console's fonts when they are mounted (pe/gfx/system_fonts.hpp). Greek, Thai and
Arabic still come from the console's fonts alone: their catalogs are checked against
those when PE_SYSTEM_FONTS names a folder holding copies of them, and only for their
Latin text otherwise.
